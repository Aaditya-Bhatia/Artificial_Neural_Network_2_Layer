# Artificial_Neural_Network_2_Layer


Part 1:
Uses numpy to create a two layered neural network, where the derivatives of weights and biases are calculated in linear algebra.
The cost function is reduced by a factor of alpha. Trainings and predictions are made on XOR gate.

Part 2:
MNIST dataset is split into 10 folds with the corresponding box plot of the each digit. 

Part3:
The 2 layer artificial neural network is trained with reduction in Cost Function with increase in iterations.
